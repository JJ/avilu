# 1 - The Girl in Space

Claas dreamed of warm colors, which coalesced like golden honey melting from a honeycomb. Shapes had lost their meaning for her. She was the world and the world was she. Claas had become a tiny part of an eternal whole.

A tiny part with a conscience. With a name. A tiny part, which like everything would flow back to this oneness of which it always had belonged to. New parts would come into being. With new names and new consciences. In the universe nothing died it just changed its shape.

Without warning the colors, for which she had no name, in front of Claas' inner eye disappeared. For the fraction of a second she felt all her organs pulsating unpleasantly in her body. Her visual field lit up: A pin sharp 360 degree panorama of her surroundings.
