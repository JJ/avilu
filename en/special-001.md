# Avilu - 1st Special - The nine-headed hydra

*Sir Lancray remained in noble silence, while his wiener glistened beautifully in the evening sun. As he was standing on one of the several balconies of castle Norfyorn, the wind carried a refreshing breeze from the snow covered mountains, which playfully caressed his flaccid manhood.*

What a beautiful evening, *thought Sir Lancray full of melancholy, well aware of the meaningful silence, which was only interrupted by the gentle flopping of the nine-headed hydra dangling between his bare legs. A furious beast - just for now sound asleep...*

The story went on like this. Mini read it twice, just to make sure, that what she was reading was actually written there, on this paper in the neat handwriting dancing on the blue lines like a ballet of little snakes.

"Well, Lila, I guess that is an F", she said with a voice, which sounded like opals gliding over night black velvet. Fate had been kind to Mini Treje as she could have become easily a singer or radio host with her voice. But the woman nearing the end of her twenties didn't care about fate.

That is why she had become an elementary school teacher.

"Miss Treje, that isn't fair!" Lila had jumped up from her chair and was flashing her eyes angrily at her teacher. "Timo's gay robot story got a B and his writing style is no better than that of a mentally challenged toddler. And then. And then. And then."

Just god knew, why Lilas parents had given her child this name. The seven year old girl had nothing which resembled even remotely the color she was named after. Lila was black. Or more chocolate brown. So why call your child Lila if it doesn't look purple. Not that children usually looked purple, which made the name even more stupid.

So, thought Mini, one could say that she took after her parents.

"Timo's story made sense. Do you expect a reward for obscenities?"

"Obscenities? I'm doing *Art*!"

"Dear Lila Hestingsen, Goethe did art. Schiller did art. And correct me if I'm wrong, but both of them didn't write quite this much about genitals."

"That is my free way of expression. Freedom of the arts!"

Mini Treje sighted quietly. Why had children around this age to know everything better? They behaved as if they understood the world, but they didn't have a fucking clue how it really worked.

"Okay, let us assume this *story*", Mini managed to pronounce the word *story* like nasty curse, "is really the expression of your freedom of the arts. It is not, but if it would be, it would be still total bull crap. You are not telling me any story."

"It is more kind of an essay thing. I am mediating more an emotion. It is a modern way of writing."

"And what kind of emotion would that be?"

"Well, the emotion of a nobleman, who is standing unclothed on the balcony of his castle and bathes is manhood in the warm evening sun. And the melancholy of the wind, which plays with his nine-headed-"

"Okay, enough." Mini massaged her temples. She was annoyed. "No one who is even remotely right in the head is standing naked on his balcony. And by the way men don't have nine-headed hydras. You never listened in biology class, did you?"

"Miss Treje, have you ever seen a penis?", asked Lili without batting an eye. Seven year olds nowadays. "If a penis doesn't look like a nine-headed hydra, then please tell me a better word to describe this nine wiggling tentacle-things between their legs."

The class was giggling.

"The best would be, if you wouldn't describe it at all. Lila, you have time until tomorrow to submit a proper story, then I withdraw the F. Any objections? Yes? Then tell your parents and they can contact me."

Therewith Mini Treje declared the discussion ended and signaled Lila to sit down again, who grudgingly obeyed her, while she was trying to kill her teacher with her glances.

Mini grinned to herself. Obviously the girl didn't want her parents to know of the little dirty story she wrote. Well, children being children.

---

"Can you believe that?", asked Mini Treje while she was sweeping through the open refrigerator in search of some junk food, "I fucking hate children, who are in this rebellious phase. You have nothing in here, have you?"

Mini pointed on the open fridge. It belonged her two year older sister Miki. Her parents had some strange humor while naming them. Mini had crashed at her sisters place. And the owner of the fridge was leaning beside it at the clean kitchen unit.

"All you eat is vegetables? Are you a fucking rabbit?"

"It's mostly Leo's food. Recently I don't have time to eat at home." Leo was Miki's husband.

"Too busy? Well then tell your man, that he should get his lazy ass up and work like honest people. I mean, like we do. By the way, where is he? Haven't seen him today?"

"Some gallery meeting in the northern districts. They are doing some exhibitions in schools now."

"Uh, I hope he doesn't come to my school."

"Don't worry, they do it just for high schools."

"You know, nothing personal, but my first graders are doing better in art class, than your hubby. You know, at least they are painting the sun yellow and don't make it purple and square and tell me later with a straight face it's the sun."

"Well that's abstract art, Mini."

"Whatever. I still don't understand why you hang out with this looser dude. I mean, you could get like a cool guy." Mini decided that the fridge contained nothing of interest and let her sister close it for her. "Your superior, you know Ice Face, looks like he must be a beast in bed. Have you ever-"

"No, I haven't. And Leo is a nice guy." Something in the voice of her sister told Mini, that she had crossed a line.

"You know, I'm ... I guess I'm just jealous. I mean I'm so desperate right now I would even put up with your lame ass hubby."

"Don't you dare."

"That was a joke, 'kay? But you know, this  kids nowadays are like fucking sharks. They can smell your weaknesses. Your deepest fears. Even one single fucking drop of blood and they rip you to shreds. Why else would a seven year old nigger girl tell me a fairy tale about nine-headed hydra penises?"

"I wouldn't read so much into it", said Miki, "That girl probably just had fun writing that story. She is at the age where boys become interesting for her."

"I swear, she was making fun of me. I mean - come on - nine-headed hydras."

"You never heard of them?"

"What?"

"They are actually quite common in certain circles. It's a new fad."

"You are joking."

"No."

"Does Leo-"

"No!"

"Mhm? So how do you exactly know? Watching some illegal Internet porn again, sis', huh?"

"No. Work. You really don't want to know what goes through some peoples minds, when it comes to sex. The hydra-thing is actually quite harmless compared to other ... eh *phenomena*."

"So this is for real?"

"I'm telling you."

"And it is better than ... than the original, I mean?"

"Seems this way. You want an address? We raided a club last Thursday, but they were actually clean. And it had some style. Quite comfy. Wouldn't go there as customer though."

"No, thanks. I'm not *that* desperate."

Mini felt beaten. A seven year old knew more about sexuality than her. But before Mini could feel too humiliated, she noticed a letter in her hand.

She didn't really know where it came from, but it seemed natural that it was there. So she opened it. The handwriting dancing like a ballet of snakes on the lines seemed strangely familiar to Mini. The header stated: Story Court.

Mini didn't spend time to think about the meaning of the words, as she was distracted by the fact that her environment had changed. Dramatically.

She noticed, that she was sitting on a chair, which wasn't too uncomfortable, but had a disturbing and pulsating live of its own. It was unsettling.

Mini was in a courtroom. One of this old ones, which smell like heavy wood and dust. It wasn't just her chair that was weird, but everything. At least everything inside the room. The courtroom itself looked actually pretty normal, aside from the huge horrible painting in the golden frame over the bench. The painting style seemed terribly familiar. Was it one of Leos monstrosities?

Monstrosities. Though the painting was certainly worse, there was another monstrosity sitting at the bench. It was blue. And it was fat. And it had two dozen tentacles, a powdered wig and a quadruple chin. Obviously it was the judge as it had the wig and was sitting at the bench. And Mini had to admit, that the terror it was emitting, was in a strange harmony with the mud yellow painting of Leo.

In front of the bench with the fat, blue monster judge, there stood an old man with silver hair. He had a certain aristocratic air around him. And he was butt naked.

Mini stared at the wiggling *thing* between his legs. She had never seen anything remotely similar to this before. But on the other hand how many penises had she seen in her life? Mini had to admit, that *nine-headed hydra* described the pulsating alien organism between the man's legs quite accurately.

"So it is correct, Sir Lancray, that you were enjoying the evening on your balcony in nothing but your Adams costume?", asked the monster, while repositioning the tiny wig on his wabbly blue head.

"That is correct, your honor. What would the life of a man be, if not standing on a balcony and enjoying a fresh breeze between his legs?"

"That makes no fucking sense.", said Mini out loud. She was actually just listening with half an ear, but she had realized that there was a Santa Claus in the jury, who seemed to have a part-time job as model for men's deodorant.

"Miss Treje, do you have anything to say?", asked the monster judge her, with a voice, that reminded her more of a frog than a giant blue monster.

"Why is there a fucking hippie in the jury?" Mini pointed on some lame ass dude with flowers in his hair. If he would shave and tie his hair to a pony, he would resemble uncannily to Leo.

"I'm sure the jury member would prefer if you call him Jesus of Nazareth instead of *hippie*. Please abide to the rules, Miss Treje. You are already in a bad situation. Do you think you can afford to make it worse?", asked the monster.

"Bad situation? You mean this weird ass drug trip here I'm currently having?"

"No", the monster managed to wrinkle its forehead and its chin simultaneously, "I'm sure you are well aware about the crimes you have committed."

"Objection.", cried a potato in a suit sitting on a chair beside Mini with a high pitched voice, that hurt in the ears, "The defendant is not sentenced yet. There is no proof that she committed alleged crimes."

"So let's ask the jury", said the judge monster without paying much attention to the potato, which was Minis attorney.

"Do find Miss Treje guilty for denouncing Lilas masterpiece only second to the writings of E. Schwarz and questioning the mental integrity of Sir. Lancray?"

"Guilty.", the verdict of the jury was unanimous. And the small voice of Minis potato attorney crying *Objection* disappeared in the powerful chorus.

"Very well, the jury has spoken.", said the judge monster and started to drum a melody with its four hammers on its bench.

"Miss Treje, I hereby sentence you to artist hell."

"You guys are nuts. I have a freaking potato as attorney, that wasn't a fair trail at all."

Mini noticed Lila grinning from one ear to another on the opposite side of the court, while Sir Lancray had bowed down to her and was whispering something in her ear. Mini got again a good look on his nine tailed hydra. This time from behind.

She would have liked to look at it a little longer, but the ground ripped with an eardrum shattering screetch and Mini was thrown in the night of the abyss.

She found herself twirling in a kaleidoscope of black and white.

*Mini was lost in a big gray city.*

*Life seemed meaningless, like every day.*

*A gray rhapsody where metaphors had become metaphors.*

*Life had become just a space holder for some intricate meaning.*

*She had a smoke.*

*She waited.*

*And she waited a little more.*

*Then she moved until every movement seemed stationary.*

*Amalgamating grayness.*

*Liquid mercury flowing through her veins.*

*Life had lost all its meaning.*

*The space holder had just become emptiness.*

*And the city was gray.*

For the fraction of second Mini believed to hear her own name in the nothingness. Then she felt a stinging pain spreading in her cheeks.

She was pulled back to reality.

Still slightly confused she looked at the face of her sister, who had bowed down over her. Mini was laying on the cold kitchen tiles. She felt sick. Very sick. And couldn't see very clearly. There was a ringing noise in her ear and her cheeks were burning like hell.

Apparently her sister had smacked her quite generously left and right to bring her back to her senses.

"Uh, I thought I was gonna die of boredom. I was in a freaking art house movie.", said Mini still a little shaky as she sat up and was trying to put the pieces of what she had just witnessed together in her head.

"That fucking little cunt, cursed me, didn't she? I'm so going to rip her nigger ass open to the ears. What is wrong with the children these days?"

"You might be actually one of the reasons for what is wrong with them", said Miki with a smile on her lips while she handed her sister a glass of water and a transparent pill.

Mini swallowed the pill without the water and felt instantly better. The little capsule contained a broadband anticurse. Not the weak stuff you can get in the pharmacy, but the real deal. Military grade.

The moment the pill touched her tongue, her nausea and the noise in her ears disappeared, leaving behind just a little euphoria, that made Mini wonder, why she had been this angry, just a moment ago.

Good mood was one of the side effects of these anticurses. It wouldn't keep her from giving Lila a hell of a lecture, but the urge to murder that little bitch right now with a sledgehammer, had disappeared.

"Nine-headed hydras, mh?", she said a little lost in her thoughts. There was an image, she couldn't get out of her mind, even though the anticurse was working.

"So where was this club again, you told me of?"
